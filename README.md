# Bereal Data Analysis

**Overview**

This project uses the **BeReal Time History API** to analyze the timing of BeReal moments in the Americas region.

The time periods are categorized in four:

	•	Nighttime: 12:00 AM to 5:59 AM
	•	Morning: 6:00 AM to 11:59 AM
	•	Afternoon: 12:00 PM to 5:59 PM
	•	Evening: 6:00 PM to 11:59 PM

The project fetches real-time and historical data using the API and visualizes the frequency of moments across the time periods.
